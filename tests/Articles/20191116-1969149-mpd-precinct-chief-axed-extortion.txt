MPD PRECINCT CHIEF AXED FOR EXTORTION

MANILA, Philippines - The commander of a Manila Police District (MPD) precinct, where a drug suspect was illegally detained while four police officers extorted money from his wife, was relieved from his post yesterday.

National Capital Region Police Office chief Brig. Gen. Debold Sinas ordered the relief of Capt. Salvador Iñigo, commander of the police community precinct in Baseco, Tondo, for command responsibility.

Iñigo's removal came after Sinas and MPD director Brig. Gen. Bernabe Balba heard his explanation regarding the involvement of his subordinates Corporals Nickson Mina, Juan Carlo Guzman and Francis Mikko Gagarin and Pat. Tom Hikilan in the kidnapping of alleged drug pusher Kelvie Panansang and the extortion of P200,000 from Panansang's wife.

Iñigo was placed on floating status at the MPD headquarters. Capt. Rodel Borbe replaced him.

The four policemen were arrested by Col. Ronald Lee, chief of the Integrity Monitoring and Enforcement Group (IMEG) during an entrapment operation in the precinct.

Lee rescued Panansang, who was being held at the precinct's detention facility without charges being filed against him.

The IMEG chief ordered the release of Panansang as there is no evidence against him.

Panansang and his wife "would serve as complainants in the kidnapping and extortion cases we filed against the four policemen before the Manila prosecutor's office" on Thursday, Lee said.

Lee said the four policemen would remain in IMEG custody pending the resolution of the case.
